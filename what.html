      <p id="blog1" class= "col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">While there are eye catching headlines foretelling automation will result in mass unemployment, most experts agree this is not a likely future scenario. According to a McKinsey study, history shows that technology has in fact created significant employment opportunities while driving shifts in industries; see the shrinking of the agricultural and manufacturing industries in Figure 5 along with the rise of other industries (Manyika et al. 2017).  This does not diminish the significance and reality of the common fear of being replaced by robots or technology. It has been a common sentiment since the days of Aristotle.  A slightly more modern example can be seen from the 1930’s, when economist Johan Maynard Keynes made popular the phrase “technological unemployment’ to describe the predicted large scale unemployment as a result of automation. However, we have yet to experience this type of mass unemployment, not because the technology is not available to replace the roles, but rather because the market adoption is slow and the infrastructure takes time to be upgraded. Ultimately the lag between technology and capital investment of corporates is allowing time for the workforce to adjust and catch up. This is likely to be the case over next ten years as well.<br><br>It is estimated that 20% of the current U.S. workforce is in industries that will grow, while another 20% are in ones that will shrink by 2030 (Bakhshi et al. 2017). Office support roles such as admirative, secretarial and sales roles are anticipated to decrease by 20%. Also roles with predictable physical work, such as manufacturing production is projected to decrease by 31% (Manyika et al. 2017). Along with all trends we have seen to date, there will be continued technological changes and automation which impact routine-based work across all industries.</p>

      <p id="blog1" class= "col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"> If history is any indication of the future, we can assume by 2030, 8-9% of roles will be new types of occupations which have never existed before. While there is generally more consensus in the types of role that will decreases, we can anticipate gains in key industries especially in light of the mega trends previously discussed. There is predicted growth in consumer demand from emerging economies with the raise of their middle class. There will also be an increase in occupation in health care to support the global aging population with a a predicted 30% growth in healthcare occupations. Professional occupations will also still be in demand with manager and executives anticipated to increase by15% particularly in creative, digital, design, and green industries.<br><br> Technology development & deployment will continue to be in demand with occupations predicted to increase by 35%. The infrastructure and building industry is predicted to grow considering the aging infrastructure in the U.S.. This ties closely to the anticipated growth of occupations in renewable energy. <br><br> We can also anticipate marketization of previously unpaid work, such as child and elderly care, cooking, gardening, etc. There is also anticipated growth in agriculture, skilled trades and construction as well as non-tradable services like food preparation, hospitality, etc. These low skill occupations are a result of increased consumer growth. There is an opportunity to re-skill and take advantage of changing demand from future consumers, transitioning to artisanal employment like brewing, baking, textiles, etc. For the full summary of occupations which will be in demand see figure 6 above (Bakhshi et al. 2017 and Manyika et al. 2017). </p>

      <p id="blog1" class= "col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">Within a workforce there remains a very high degree of persistence in the skills required. We can consider the workforce a social institution with its own norms, rituals, and habits which are difficult to change even with the dynamic and rapid disruptions of new technology. For example, the transformation of the workforce from a manufacturing to a service or knowledge-based economy has been much slower than our transition from an agricultural to a manufacturing economy. The skills required in 2030 will not likely be an upending transformation from what we do today, but rather an evolution.  It is nevertheless transforming, and we should consider the ways in which it is doing so, to ensure we are collectively aligning, preparing and shaping the future. <br><br>A common method of classification and categorization of skills and tasks is Cognitive vs. Manual and Routine vs. Non-routine. Form 1960 – 1998, unsurprisingly, the demand for routine cognitive and manual tasks decline, while non-routine cognitive and manual tasks grew in importance (Autor et al, 2003). These non-routine cognitive tasks are linked to skills in expert thinking and complex communication.  Nearly all net job growth in the U.S. since 1980 has been in occupations which are social-skill intensive(Deming et al., 2015).  It is important to be reminded we are highly social creatures operating in a social institution. We often tend to separate our human nature from the work we do, but what these trends highlight, is the importance of our nature and our unique abilities which will continue to be in high demand in 2030. Our future work will require us to leverage this flexibility to navigate complex emotional and social situations if we are to have a productive workplace. <br> In 2017, Pearson, the learning company, Nesta, an innovation foundation, and the University of Oxford published an extensive review on the skills required for our future work. According to their research, interpersonal competencies such as teaching, perceptiveness, and coordination is the critical skill in the future. They also noted three other important abilities:  higher-order cognitive skills, such as originality and fluency of ideas, learning strategies, such as the ability to set goals, ask relevant questions, and apply knowledge meaningfully in new environments, and lastly systems thinking, or the ability to recognize, understand, and act on interconnections and feedback loops. This closely aligns with the trend identified in the U.S. labor force from 1980 to 2012; roles with high social skills grew by roughly 10 percentage points as a share of the U.S. labor force (Deming et al., 2015). These results reiterate the importance of human nature. What we tend to find easy and enjoy doing as part of our jobs, is what will continue to be in demand in the future. <br><br> 
      <img src="images/Slide13.jpg" class= "col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
      Regarding those skill which decline in importance in the future, it is fairly straight forward: those which are not important for face to face interactions are less required. For a full list of their research on the skills, abilities, and knowledge required for the 2030 workforce, refer to figure 7 (Bakhshi et al. 2017).<br><br>However, there is an argument that we should not be looking at skills or tasks per se but rather goals and problems to be solved. Since Adam Smith’s division of labor, we have been specializing work more and more, to create processes which has resulted in people doing routine monotonous tasks. People do not particularly enjoy this level of specialization. And in our continued pursuit of productivity gains, we began to automate these types of tasks. The great historian of our time, Yuval Harari, put it best, “We don’t have to protect jobs; we have to protect people”.  The research seems to be in alignment with this direction, predicting skills for roles in the future are all human-centric, allowing people to work in unstructured environments problem solving and interacting with others – as is our nature.</p>
