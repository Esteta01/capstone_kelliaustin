      <p id="blog1" class= "col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">In an effort to continue to increase productivity and drive down costs, companies have begun to change the employment structure and employ gig or contingent workers - keeping the costs off the corporation’s balance sheets. The number of gig workers has risen dramatically, from 10% of the U.S. workforce in 2005 up to 16% in 2015 (Katz et al. 2017). In the same period, Deloitte found 94% of all net new employment was for gig workers (Moses et al., 2017). These gig workers are estimated to account for roughly 25% of the global workforce today and this figure will continue to climb (Katz et al 2017). In this economically challenging time, we are seeing organisations continue on this path, replacing full time employees with contingent workers. Gartner research shows 32% of organisations are actively doing this as a response to the pandemic in an effort to cut costs (Baker et al., 2020).   
      <br><br> WThe normalization and continuous increase in the number of gig workers will impact the 2030 workforce. The largest negative impact to the worker is the ‘Individualization of Risk,’ as the sociologist, Ulrich Beck, phrases it in his 1992 book, World Risk Society.  The worker no longer has the long-term security of a steady income stream and benefits. The corporation has effectively transferred a large portion of the risk of the business to the individual. This is what Beck describes as the transition from industrial modernity to our new modernity, where social relations and institutions are picked by the individual (Beck, 1992). As discussed in Part 1, the 2030 workforce is eager for institutional transformative change. I surmise by 2030, there will be a form of transferrable benefits (medical, unemployment, retirement, etc.) regulated by the federal government in which some of this risk is transferred back and shared with corporations.
      <br><br> A related change in working behaviors is the increase in the number of people working from home (WFH). According to the U.S. Federal Reserve, the number of people WFH has tripled in the last 15 years. The 2020 global pandemic has pushed this working style into hyper adoption. Prior to the pandemic, an estimated 5 – 15% of Americans worked from home regularly; as of April, nearly all knowledge workers, roughly 50% of Americans, were working from home due to the pandemic (Brynjolfsson et al., 2020). With the world having been forced to trial new and flexible ways of operating, it is estimated 48% of all employees in the U.S. will work from home (or other remote location) at least some of the time (Baker et al., 2020).
      <br><br>
      With the shift of more remote and flexible working, has come new found autonomy, flexible working hours, reduction in formality and reduced hierarchy. While this has been a trend for years, it has been fast tracked due to the pandemic. The success rate of this trial of working from home has been far greater than experts estimated. The main reason – everyone had to participate in the effort (as opposed to previous trials when only a selected team in the company would be the pilot group) and everyone painfully learned together how to be effective while WFH. There has been mostly positive feedback of the experience from both leaders and employees. Most impressively, productivity did not slip as nearly everyone would have assumed. Preliminary studies have found employees have more focus time, appreciate they no longer have a commute, have increased flexibility for family time, and are having shorter meetings (Singer-Velush et al, 2020).However, it has not all been a smooth and easy adoption. The main pain point discovered was the extension of the working day. A technology firm found that only 50% of their employees were able to keep their working hours to 10 hours or less per day, compared to the 80% prior to the forced WFH. But after two and half months, the figure began to trend back towards its baseline, although still a 10 - 20% longer working day than before(Berntein et al., 2020). This might be due to people taking time out of what would normally be considered working hours for personal activities and making up that time later. This is not to say in 2030 we will remain primarily working from home, but that the workforce has experienced increased autonomy, and they will change the working patterns to best suit their needs (both work and personal). The WFH and gig worker are the 2030 workforce, and will be adaptive and flexible with their working hours no longer adhering strictly to the 9 to 5.
      <br><br>
      At the start of the contingent worker  phenomenon, the gig roles were seen as non-critical and the nature of the work was more routine tasks which were easily outsourced. However, this sentiment has shifted as gig workers become more integrated into business processes and fill critical roles; they are no longer viewed as short term outsiders. The hierarchy will no longer remain between gig and full time employees. But there is a risk of creating a divide between fully remote and office based workers. Research shows when only some of the team are virtual workers, they tend feel side-lined regardless of seniority. They reported feeling less respected and identify less with the organisation compared to their office based counterparts (Bartel et al., 2011). Organisations will need to mandate all employees to be a flexible workers, otherwise they will risk creating an ‘others’ sentiment resulting in the isolation of the remote workers. Those who can use the office, should also be expected to WFH with regularity, aligning working interactions and communications across the team. The structure of the 2030 workforce will be made up of groups of networked individuals and entrepreneurs who work in small teams over multiple projects and geographies. The management style will be goal oriented as opposed to focused on presenteeism. It is assumed employees will still use the physical office, but will not be reliant or dependent upon it and the policies and procedures will eventually adapt to the working behaviors – the workers will lead the way, not the HR department. People will remain an organization’s number one asset, followed by technology.

      <p id="blog1" class= "col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">As noted above the, physical office space is one aspect of the social institution of the workplace. We explore what the physical and virtual space may be in 2030 as organizations adapt to the changes in the way people work as well as grapple with financial pressures. 
      <br><br>The physical office space has great meaning associated with it for many of us. It is our working home. It is a place that can mould us and give the opportunity to learn and grow. It is often times a separate space from our personal lives; it is a place we can reimagine and even redefine ourselves. When the physical space is connected with positive personal growth and opportunity, the space tends to have an endearing place in our hearts. But when our experience is bad, and we find there is no opportunity for personal success, it can wreak havoc on our self-identity. It is unlikely that by 2030, we will have dismissed the usefulness of a physical office space. It will remain the physical manifestation of the organisation’s culture and values and in many ways that of those who work there (even if only on occasion).
      </p>
      <p id="blog1" class= "col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"> Aside from the phycological implication of the physical space there are also clear benefits to having a physical office environment. The key benefit is it brings people together. This allows for unplanned spontaneous interactions which is linked to increased creativity and helps to build weak ties across the organisation which is also associated with increased innovation. It also leaves opportunity for small talk which builds trust amongst peers and it fosters closer relationships between manager and their team members. It is true, we will continue to build our abilities to do all of these activities virtually, but there is a strong case to retaining the physical environment, in some form, to nurture these interactions. 
      <br><br>Aside from these less tangible benefits of working in an office, in 2030 the office will server two primary functions. The first, bringing people together to solve complex issues and the second is for supporting learning and development. Let’s first consider the solving of complex issues. While a portion of our work may be done independently and from any location, there will be a need to come together to work though highly complex scenarios. We will need project-like spaces that allow for teams consisting of multiple different subject matter experts as well as big picture thinkers, decision makers, and AI systems to collaborate together simultaneously. We will be using real time data that is processes and analysed by AI systems feed to multiple parties for review, comment, and advice. Perhaps the closest thing we have today is a business war room, but imagine this with much technology integrated and broader skillsets in the a single room. 
      <br><br> The second function of the office space in 2030 will be more greatly focused on learning and development. It is critical for employees to be able to absorb new information and have the opportunity to operationalize it. This is true for current employees but also for new hires. Consider the onboarding process. While the introduction to the organization can be easily shifted to the virtual setting, creating relationships and training people on the nuanced ways a team operates, requires time to be spent with the new joiners. It is much easier when these people can sit next to experienced team members and observer how they work. This allows the new joiners to connect in a meaningful way, express themselves, and integrate their abilities and skills with the broader team. It is not yet clear how we can achieve this virtually in as an effective way as in person. It is estimated 30% of the U.S. workforce will need to switch occupations at least once (Manyika et al., 2017) and as we noted in part one, there is a gap in the education system. This means the 2030 worker will need to be continuously educating, or upskilling, herself to ensure she is employable. Organization will create both time and spaces for this education to happen on-the-job rather than in-addition-to an employee’s primary job description as a result of the lack of existing qualified candidates. A physical space for us to come together to learn will be a critical role of the future office.
      <br><br>It is important to note, the transformation of our physical places of work lags behind the technological changes in the ways we work. The physical space simply cannot evolve at the same rapid pace of technology; corporate real estate has a longer lifecycle with lease terms of up to ten years in the U.S. and a design and build process which also tends to have long timelines compared to technology development. This means the average knowledge worker is operating in spaces which were designed for the ways of working in the prior decade. It is not surprising that we see headlines questioning the usefulness of office spaces. The aptly named comedy series “The Office” is wildly popular, as it mocked the remnants of outdated rituals and working norms which are still pervasive in too many of our working lives. It is painfully relatable and reassuring to the viewer, they are justified in their daily workplace annoyances. A dated physical space reinforces old norms. But here we can lean on future technology advancements which will continue to rapidly evolve, and we will find new ways to socialize virtually that feels more nuanced and natural. For those who focus on the workplace development, we should be looking at least ten years into the future and designing for that future user. 
      <br><br> Since we are estimating the office will still be relevant in 2030, we can assume the amount of real estate required for an organisation will be reduced significantly and the type of spaces offered will be to bolster what cannot be done virtually with ease. We can also consider the location of the future workplace; perhaps we no longer need a single head quarter office in the most expensive central business district. We know, based on the Allan curve, the level of interaction between colleagues drops significantly once there is a distance of only eight meters (Allan, 1984). Thus, there is limited value add from a collaboration perspective, in having multiple contiguous floors in an office building, when the average employee rarely explores beyond a quarter of their assigned office floor. Instead, an organisation can review where their employees live, and identify a couple of locations in a single city which are most convenient for the majority of people to commute to. Organizations may consider offering subscription to their entry level employees to access coworking sites and support those who prefer not to work from home or may need a physical space to support their daily work. In short, the physical space will be an add-on type of befit to our virtual workspace.  
      <br><br> Employee’s transition from being a physical office-based worker to virtual worker is already underway but will be solidified by 2030 as the norm. As noted above, the physical environment will take time to reflect our new norms, but technology has not and will no wait. We already have the foundational framework and tools to allows us to be effective virtual workers. The Microsoft365 platform with Teams is a great example, offering video, IM chat, and audio communications, while allowing the formation of individual groups, networks and channels. People can work on documents simultaneously and there is even an AI personal assistance to remind you of tasks you have not yet completed based on your communication exchange with colleagues. With big shifts to working behaviours, typically the technology is not the limiting factor but rather people’s willingness to adopt. With the global pandemic pushing everyone to embrace these new working practices, we have skipped at least 5 years’ worth of change resistance. We also already have professional social platforms, like LinkedIn, connecting people with available roles and networks. LinkedIn is also building up their professional development capabilities, shoring up their future as an outsourced learning and development provider. Gig workers already find their freelance work via platforms like UpWork and Fiverr. And the global workforce has affordable access to some of the best university courses with an impressive array of learning opportunities on platforms like Coursera, EdX, Udemy and  Skillshare.  
      <br><br> The primary aspect of our virtual workplace which is fundamentally lacking, is the social experience. We tend to be more transactional,  only reaching out to colleagues when we need something. We have reduced our meeting times, leaving limited time for the causal small talk, we miss those coffee catch ups and enjoying lunch with each other. So how might this improve by 2030? Perhaps we embrace VR and have our coffee sessions, enjoying a freshly brewed cup from home, while ‘in’ a VR coffee shop with a colleague. Perhaps AI will help in connecting us with people in our various networks whom we ‘match’ with in term of interests, based on algorithms. This would allow us to spontaneously meet new people and help us to ‘break the ice’ with new acquaintances expanding out network. While I am unsure of exactly how AI will help us to bridge this social gap we all currently feel, I am confident it will happen before the physical workplace environment for most of us changes.
