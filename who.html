    <div class= "row">
      <p id="blog1" class= "col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">The future U.S. labour force is projected to be older, more diverse, and highly educated according to Buckley et al. (2017). The US labour force is getting older as a result of both the low birth rate, which is a common challenge amongst mature economies globally, as well as the extension of elder participation in the workforce. As gleaned from Figure 1, the share of the labor force by those aged 55 years and above has continued to grow (Bureau of Labor Statistics). We also see a trend of delayed entry by the youngest cohorts; this is likely a result of extended years in the traditional education system. However, I would challenge the notion of the continuation of delayed entry as many are finding the education structure is not conducive to our current and future dynamic working environments with limited transparency between formal education and entry level jobs. I project more and more people will seek alternative forms of education allowing them to enter the workforce earlier and continue learning through the course of their careers. This would result in maintaining the current levels of the 16-24 cohorts’ participation as the group itself is growing at a slower rate than the rest of the age segments.<br>
      <br>
      The current trend of a more diverse workforce in the U.S. will continue; this is based on immigration patterns as well as the steady increase of women entering the workforce since the 1960’s. While the overall participation rate is declining, woman aged 25-54 is projected to grow. The labor force is also projected to have less ‘white non-Hispanic’ men; they are forecasted to be less than 60% of the workforce by 2024 which is a sharp decline from when they represented over 75% of the workforce as recently as 1994. While Hispanics are seeing the most gains in the labor market, blacks and Asians are also increasing their share in the workforce (Toossi et al., 2015).</p>

       <p id="blog1" class= "col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">Another trend which is projected to continue is the raise in education levels of the U.S. workforce. Every generation has become more educated than the previous generation. Today and into the future, people are more likely to gain education levels beyond high school. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, roughly 40% of the labor force had at least a bachelor’s degree. Another 26% had some college or associate degree.<br>
      <br>
      Only 27% of college graduates work in jobs directly related to their majors (Buckley et al., 2017). While this is not necessarily bad, as it appears the ability to attain a degree is a signal of work ethic, goal setting, and time management skills; it does raise the question - Do we need to spend so much time and money on something that is not adequately aligned with or preparing us with the skills required? This is primarily due to an outdated education structure. We are using a 20th century education format for a 21st century cohort. Educators often refer to the 40-year gap between education content and current practice, but this gap is widening with the rapid pace of technology development. I surmise there will be a significant shift in this space to allow greater flexibility perhaps combining work and study similar to that of an apprentice. There will be an integration of work and education to ensure the employees are trained with the skills required.</p>

      <p id="blog1" class= "col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">It is helpful to take a step back to survey the larger trends influencing our behaviours and opportunities. While we are focused on the future of work and those who will be participating in it, it is important to be reminded, these workers are not operating in isolation. All transformation and advancements in our future ways of working are directly linked to the global challenges we collectively face politicly, environmentally, economically, and socially. The list below highlight the key mega trends influencing the future workforce. While there are several other major trends occurring, the list below focuses on the ones which are most impactful to the workforce:</p>  
          <p class= "col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12" style="padding:0; margin: 0;">
            <ul id="blog1" class= "col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12" style="padding-top:0; padding-left:50px; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0;">
              <li>Technology Advancements & Discontinuities – with the increased rate of change and automation the workforce is fighting to keep up and stay relevant.</li> 
              <li>Aging Population – this will impact the industries and occupations as well as the age mix of the labor force.</li>
              <li>Urbanization –UN predicts, by 2030 4.9 billion people will live in urban areas with a 72% increase by 2050. However, the brunt of this is anticipated to be concentrated in the developing economies (UN, WUP. 2011).</li>
              <li>Shifting Global Economy / Income Inequality – there will be a continued balancing of power amongst countries. The gap between developed and developing economics will continue to shrink. Developing countries have much to gain if the right steps are taken in regard to education and ensuring a business-friendly landscape. Developed nations, like the U.S., face mostly negative repercussions; Increased pressure on wages due to global competition and automation, shrinking of the middle class, and mal-alignment of job skill supply & demand.</li>
              <li>Climate Change – extreme weather and resource scarcity</li> 
          </ul></p>
      <p id="blog1" class= "col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">The global economy has raised more people out of extreme poverty than any other time period in history and elevated the developing countries. While this is undoubtedly a great success, it has resulted in negative repercussions in the U.S., particularly impacting the middle class and will continue to do so as manufacturing and other middle skilled roles decline (Engler et al. 2018). Figure 3 illustrates the global ‘winners and losers’ of globalization in terms of real income growth.  The American dream of a life which offers opportunity and financial security has been fading for decades with the middle class in the U.S. being squeezed. In fact, the absolute income mobility (the number of children who earn more than their parents) has dropped by roughly 70%. In a review of absolute income mobility, researchers found 90% of people born in 1940 earned more than their parents while only 50% did who were born in the 1980’s (Chetty et al. 2017). This is creating strong sense of both individual failure and a lack of trust in the U.S. economic system.</p>

    <p id="blog1" class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">If we hone in further on the increased income inequality and rapid urbanization, we find a specific group suffering from the combination of these trends; the non-college educated middle skilled urban workers. While the middle- skilled labor group previously comprised 43% of the labor force in the ‘80s, they now comprise just 29% (Autor et. Al 2019). The level of middle skilled employment available in cities has dramatically declined along the same time period from 15% to nearly 0% in 2015. These non-college educated urban workers have seen their wages declined by two thirds, while college educated worker’s wages have steadily increased. Automation and tech advancements have significantly reduced the demand for this laborers market (Autor et al. 2019).<br><br>The mega trends of shifting global power and technology advancements have given rise to rapid automation and there are no signs of this slowing. According to a 2017 McKinsey report, for roughly 60% of current occupations, 30% of the tasks can be automated (Manyika et al., 2017). It is predicted by 2030, 375 million workers globally will need to find new roles, with the U.S. accounting for over 10% of that figure - 38.6 million workers; see figure 4.<br><br>The above does not take into account the more recent economic hardships faced as a result of the current economic disruptions brought on by the global COVID-19 pandemic which is projected to last through 2021.The 2008 financial crisis was supposed to be a once in a generation economic crisis, yet here we are again, only 11 years later.<br><br>Millennials, who will account for the largest segment of the 2030 labour force, roughly 50%, were hit particularly hard by the 2008 economic downturn due to the poor timing which aligned with their entry into the labour market. It resulted in many people taking work they were potentially overqualified for or at a reduced salary than they would earn in a healthy market. This has had lasting negative effects as a person’s entry role sets the trajectory for their entire career. We see this affirmed in PEW research data; when adjusted for age, Millennials, regardless of education level earn 20% less than Gen X did at the same age (25 – 37 years old). This is not the case for previous generations and is further evidence of the fading American Dream (Stern et al., 2020 and Chetty et al. 2017)</p>

      <p id="blog1" class= "col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">These trends allow us not only to predict future scenarios, but also to reflect on the impact they have on the future workforce, their collective experiences and perspective. By empathize with the future workforce we can also appreciate their future sentiments: a desire for large scale change and appetite for increased government intervention while remaining cautiously pessimistic about the future. <br><br>The hit of the 2008 financial crisis and following recession has left an entire generation with a pessimistic leaning outlook on the economy and their personal chances of success. Millennials are delaying life milestone such as getting married, having children, and buying homes. The average age of marriage has risen from 22 years old in 1965 to 28 in 2017, according to PEW research. And CDC data shows a the average age of first time parents on the rise. In 1972 the average age was 24 years old and has risen to 28.5 years in 2020 (Stern et al., 2020). They are a hesitant generation, cautions to spend in the big ways which power’s the economy. This sentiment is likely to linger for a lifetime, especially considering the current economic disruption which is only re-affirming their distrust in the system.<br><br>However, with this cautious economic outlook also comes a desire for change -  large scale, structural change. Americans’ are more in favour of federal government intervention now, that at any point in the past 58 years. In a recent poll, 82% of younger Americans (18-32 years old) agree “it is important the U.S. government commit to reducing economic inequality”(DiMaggio et al, 2020). This desire can be seen within the democrat  political sphere and the rise and of socialist democratic candidates like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang. Their appeal to the 30 and under crowd anther signal of this shifting sentiment. Our future workforce is hopeful, keen for change, but also cautious.<br><br>When it comes to the future workforce’s view on work, there appears to be a philosophical struggle. The U.S. has always praised hard work and the entrepreneurial spirit, perhaps to an extreme. An example of this is the U.S.’s limitations of annual leave. Internationally, Americans are well known for not taking holidays further reinforced by the lack of federally mandated annual leave allowances. On average, Americas  used only 17.4 days annually, roughly half of what other developed countries avail. 55% of Americans failed to use all their annual leave with 54% of workers admitting to feeling guilty about taking time off (Sampson et al 2020).  For many the act of work is moral. However, the future workforce has come to see they do not have the power to control their own destiny in the same way their parents or grandparents once did.<br><br>I anticipate a shift in value and meaning of work and how we derive social worth; As Bertrand Russell so eloquently stated, “...a great deal of harm is being done in the modern world by belief in the virtuousness of work, and that the road to happiness and prosperity lies in an organized diminution of work.” in his article, In Praise of Idleness. He emphasises, work is a means to leisure and I believe we are in the process of this ‘meaning’ transformation in the U.S. today. The 2030 workforce is grappling with emotional process and realization. People will begin also to look for meaning outside of work more than ever before and the future workforce will expect complete flexibility in their working schedules to best accommodate the more meaningful aspects of their lives.</p>
