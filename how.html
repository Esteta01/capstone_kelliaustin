However, it is not as simple as de-coupling the tasks within a process as this does not lead to a practical or productive workflow. Mot importantly it does not realize the complementariness between technology and people.</p>

      <p id="blog1" class= "col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">AI now stretches across a broad range of diverse topics supporting more fields than ever before. The benefits of a partnership is continuously making its case. If we take for example, the shocking moment in 1997 with IBM’s supercomputer, Deep Blue, beat the grandmaster chess player, Victor Kasparov, it was affirmed: electronic  intelligence had surpassed human intelligence, at least in some form. While this moment is viewed as a milestone in AI, there was an even more remarkable chess tournament a few years later, which is less widely discussed.  In this tournament, the victor was not a grandmaster nor a computer. It was a team comprised of a couple of amateur chess players and three computers. This showed, the partnership between less proficient humans and less powerful computers was superior to both the best human and most powerful AI. Another more recent example can been seen in the medical field, in diagnostics. Research again shows the synergy between technology and people during cancer screening detection. AI has an error rate of 7.5% while the human error rate is 3.5%. However, there is an 85% reduction in errors when they partner together, with a combined error rate of just 0.5% (Wang et al., 2016). This further demonstrates how the strength of one compensates for the limitations of the other. <br><br> We humans are particularly good at living in a messy world, which is ill defined. We can easily infer what is meant and operate with ease in uncertainty. We have the ability to use our judgment based on previous experiences and intuition. AI does not have this luxury. AI requires very well-defined parameters and a clearly identified problem. Yet their capacity for information processing are far beyond the cognitive ability of humans. The key to the partnership is in the way we use knowledge. It is people that create knowledge; much of what we consider knowledge is an abstract social agreement of human’s interpretation of the world. AI then uses this knowledge in remarkable ways to reveal patterns and make predications. We are able to extend human’s ability to address complex issues by allowing both groups to focus on their strengths.<br><br> Humans will play the critical role to bridge the social processing of knowledge to electronic intelligence. In a 2018 report, Accenture outlined 3 key roles for people to connect with AI; They anticipate Explainers to interpret the outputs of AI systems, Sustainers to optimize the effectiveness of the systems and Trainers to feed the system’s capacity for judgement (Accenture, 2018). However, I find this perspective shortsighted when considering the future of work and the true potential of Human – AI symbiosis. I instead, envision a much more dynamic working relationship between the two. We can take an example from today and extrapolate a potential future scenario; consider our use of digital work platforms, such as Microsoft Teams, and add AI as a critical team member. A small team collectively working on a project, reviewing and contributing to the work real time, making comments on findings (both human and AI) as well as AI sharing its own insights from various sensors, real time data analysis, etc. The group collectively coming to a consensus based on their judgment and choosing the best method and interpretation. This would mean we are all Explainers, Sustainers and potentially even Trainers.  The Accenture prediction assumptions a limited amount of mutual understanding between humans and computers, but this phase of development will surely be surpassed by 2030. We will be a fully integrated working network leveraging the strengths of both forms of intelligence.</p>

      <p id="blog1" class= "col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">The capability of robotics has come a long way; this is evident even in the way they are depicted in popular children’s culture. Consider in the early 1900s, the rusty, heartless Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz. Just a couple of generations later, the hearts of children were captivated by WALL-E’s endearing love for EVE in the Pixar film. This transformation in our culture’s view of the limitation of a robot aligns with robots influence in our workforce; their modern humble origins can be found as robotic arms in the manufacturing facilities in the automotive industry. And now, they have moved beyond task based production lines and into our social lives, into our homes (Rumba) and into the arms of our loved ones  (Paro). <br><br>The Humanoid Robotics Institute of Waseda University, which is a world leader in robotics research, anticipates humanoids will work alongside us in our everyday environments even feeling and thinking like a human. This prediction also aligns with Lovelock’s future scenario where cyborgs (as he lovingly refers to them) will design themselves based on the AI we constructed and will create their own parallel thinking and language. He surmises they will be far more intelligent than us and be self-sufficient (Lovelock, 2019). Again, Lovelock’s timescale is beyond 2030, but worth keeping in mind as we consider our path and relationship with robots.</p>

      <p id="blog1" class= "col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"> In 2004 a team from MIT published an article outlying the requirements for a Humanoid to successfully integrate into human society. At the time it seemed if not farfetched, a long way out to achieve. They highlighted the social skills which would be required: to interpret human language and behaviors, learn quickly, and be able to be taught by the average person; Otherwise they noted, the Humanoid would not be an assistant, only a sophisticated tool (Breazeal et al., 2004). In the 15 years since publishing, social robots exist. These social robots are designed to interact with people and in our environment. They register psychological and neurological insights translating them into algorithms. We have given them vision and hearing; they can capture voices, faces, tones, and emotions and have appropriate responses. They can talk, make eye contact, and use gestures to express themselves. Two great examples are CIMON the space robot and Pepper the home companion. <br><br>Significant growth is expected from the sales of consumer robots, from an estimated $5.6 billion in 2018 to $19billion by 2025 (Lathan et al., 2019). Interestingly, one of their primary future tasks is caregiving. There is huge demand for robotic elder caregiving support with this segment alone projected to grow by 30% annually through 2025 (Purtill, 2019). Social robots are stepping in to fill the gaps in our labor market.<br><br> The elderly are not the only ones who will benefit from this new form of caregiving. Children in classrooms settings too will be supported by social robots. A 2017 study found social robots were able to influence children in developing a ‘growth mindset’ – the belief that persistency in the face of challenges leads to success.  The researchers found children who interacted with robots with a growth mindset, tried harder to complete challenging tasks as opposed to those who played with a robot without a growth mindset (Park et al., 2017).  Social robots have also been found to help children with autism by introducing them to new social gestures at the appropriate pace for the child’s needs comfort level (Weir et al., 2018). Therapeutic robots like, Paro the seal, help to battle chronic loneliness by offering companionship to the elderly. Paro has been shown to provide pleasure and improve the quality of life, especially for those with dementia. <br><br> A research team from Ireland have deployed a social robot to engage with the people living in elderly care facilities in the U.S.  – see the image below. The robot’s main objective is to proactively engage socially and physically with the patients. He tells stories and jokes. He asks questions and has created a bond with many members at the facility. He is not task oriented, but rather goal oriented; to delight and bring joy to the patients.<br><br>There is an argument that robots cannot offer empathy or truly care about the life of their companions and that we humans should not take the literal humanity away from the people among us when they need us the most. While I do not disagree with such sentiments, I think there is room is for both forms of support. We know there is a gap in the labour market in this industry with high demand and limited labour to support. By using sensors and cameras these social robots can track and monitor a patient’s health in ways their human caregivers cannot. The prediction is not that we will no longer require human elderly caregivers, but that we will work in partnership to watch over and provide the most enjoyable support to the elderly.<br><Br> A fundamental question was raise by the 2004 MIT team mentioned previously, which remains – do humanoids understand our goals, beliefs, intentions and desires (Breazeal et al., 2004)? Today they may not fully, but by 2030 they most likely will.  Researchers at the Italian Institute of Technology are working on human robot interaction where the robots are partner aware allowing physical interactions and collaboration to “foster the ‘ergonomy’ of the workspace” (Tirupachuri et al., 2019). This will allow people not to be in harm’s way in potentially dangerous working environments and it also allows the robots to do the heavy lifting. We should anticipate robots being physically and socially competent performing critical support roles as coworkers in our future work environments.</p>
